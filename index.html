                    Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life
                </h3>
                “Your ikigai is at the intersection of what you are good at and what you love doing,” 
                <br>says Hector Garcia.
                <br>Ikigai is seen as the convergence of four primary elements:
                <ul>
                    <li>1.What you love (your passion)</li>
                    <li>2.What the world needs (your mission)</li>
                    <li>3.What you are good at (your vocation)</li>
                    <li>4.What you can get paid for (your profession)</li>

                    Self-Discovery
                </h3>
                “The greatest discovery in life is self-discovery. Until you find yourself you will always be someone else. Become yourself.” 
                <br>-Myles Munroe
                <br>Self discovery should be an important goal for everyone. Some people go through life playing a role to mask who they really are. Others simply become what others want them to be. “Know thyself” is a classic platitude that continues to offer a valuable reminder today. It is only through the discovery of self that we can identify our purpose and actualize our potential.

        <p>There are many enjoyable self-awareness activities for youths and students as well.

        One of these is the Sparks: Peer-to-Peer Interview worksheet. The basis of this exercise is the exploration of a child’s passions, interests, and talents, otherwise known as sparks.

        The worksheet has six simple questions that can help someone delve into these ideas.
