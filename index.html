                        Have you ever stopped to consider exactly what you want from life? Maybe you’ve taken this first step toward self-discovery, but haven’t uncovered a path toward achieving your main goals.

                        Dreams, personal values, talents, even your personality traits may not always seem to matter much in the rush of daily life. But awareness of these characteristics can give you plenty of insight into your inner self.

                        Day-to-day priorities are important, certainly. But a life that’s nothing more than a series of going through the same motions usually doesn’t provide much enjoyment.

                        If you’ve reached a point in life where you find yourself asking, “Who am I, really?” some self-discovery can help you get to know yourself a little better.

                        Self-discovery might sound like a big, intimidating concept, but it’s really just a process of:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Examining your life</li>
                            <li>Figuring out what’s missing</li>
                            <li>Taking steps toward fulfillment</li>
